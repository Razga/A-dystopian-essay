From the depths of his youth, Matthew harbored colossal dreams and an unwavering determination to reshape the world. He possessed an indescribable affinity for nature, a connection that transcended the understanding of his peers. Simultaneously, his insatiable appetite for technology, history, science, literature, and art fueled his fervor for knowledge. Most kids his age, born in the 90s, led similar lives—they played outside, had Tamagotchis, played chess, cards, and other games.

After finishing high school, he chose engineering because it was seen as a solid, rewarding, and worthwhile career path in his country. Soon, a brave engineer emerged, equipped with innate prowess for mathematics and science, ready to confront the systems wreaking havoc upon the world. After working for a few companies, he realized this was not his path, despite his peers' contentment with their corporate jobs. He needed to forge another path for himself.

In his relentless pursuit of truth, he stumbled upon the captivating realm of crypto, its allure beckoning him closer. In 2020, he embarked on a transformative journey, joining his first DAO. Oh, what an awe-inspiring odyssey it proved to be! Yet, it wasn't merely the technology itself that bewitched him, but the captivating souls he encountered—kindred spirits bound by an unwavering devotion to confronting shared societal tribulations plaguing humanity, transcending the boundaries of geography and circumstance.

Though the world was plagued by egregious disparity, with some toiling for meager wages while others reveled in exorbitant riches, the underlying challenges resonated universally. Disharmony among social classes, pervasive institutional failings, impassioned politicians stifled by legal constraints, the looming climate crisis, spiraling prices, and manipulative machinations infiltrating every echelon of media—all intertwined as the harbingers of a world teetering on the precipice of chaos. Matthew joined crypto because it was a movement that aimed to solve some of these issues. However, he noticed that since overtime that the crypto space, which was predominantly populated by rebels, passionate individuals, forever hopefuls, and nerds, was being infiltrated by entities without the best interests in mind. These so-called "psychos" tried to emulate the behaviors of authentic regens, degens, solarpunks, cypherpunks, and crypto nerds to build more ruthless, profit-driven systems.

At the same time, he observed an abrupt change in people's behavior. Everyone was glued to their smartphones, and kids became less physically engaged in play. As a curious person, he wondered where all of this could lead and what role crypto would play. He hoped that decentralization, the collaborative economy, and the funding of public goods would help guide society towards a better, brighter future.

Unfortunately, the illusion of decentralization had long been shattered. Nothing was truly private anymore; everything was on the blockchain, touted as "open data." However, corporations possessed the best tools and resources to analyze and exploit that data. They had complete access to people's digital lives, from bank accounts to medical records, eating habits, and even intimate details. Every purchase, conversation, movement, and heartbeat was stored on the blockchain, waiting to be analyzed and exploited by the most skilled team, startup, or corporation. Of course, these exploitative approaches were wrapped in inclusive, cartoony, and dreamy marketing campaigns.

The concept of inclusion had also been twisted beyond recognition. Companies touted their inclusive policies, claiming to empower the marginalized, but in reality, it was all a ploy to gather souls, data, and extract profit. Matthew had seen many fall for this trap, thinking they were finally being heard and represented, only to realize they were being manipulated.

The governments had become weak, as private individuals gained more power and influence. It was the wealthiest individuals who controlled everything now, not the elected officials. They had the means to fund their own private armies, and they had the power to sway public opinion. The laws and regulations that existed only served to protect their interests, not the interests of the people. A.I. was captured and leveraged to the max by the same profit seeking entities. They influenced the lawmakers to create laws that would allow them to use the newly created digital tools, algos and blockchains to their own advantages. The world has always been like this, the only difference is that now the social and technological gap between the people at the top and at the bottom is exponentially bigger and deeper.

In this world, the only way to fight back was to refuse to participate in the system(which was impossible) or to try to engineer better systems. Matthew knew that he was just one person, but he knew others might have the same goals and he hoped they would somehow unite and fight against this dystopian crypto. He was determined to make a difference, no matter how small.

One random morning he decided to go out for some fresh air. He walked down the deserted streets, the sound of his footsteps echoing through the empty buildings, the people that were working in them are now working from their own homes. It was a quiet morning, and the sun was just starting to peek over the horizon. He had decided to venture out today, to try and break the monotony of his daily routine.

As he walked, he came across a small coffee shop. It was a quaint little place, with tables set up outside and a few customers sitting and enjoying their morning coffee. Matthew hesitated for a moment, wondering if it was worth the risk to go inside. But the smell of freshly brewed coffee was too tempting to resist.

He walked in and was greeted by the sound of bubbling espresso machines and the chatter of customers. The barista looked up and smiled with its silly robot smile, asking what he wanted to order. Matthew ordered a simple black coffee and handed over a few metal coins. The robarista was a little shocked to see those antiques, and asked:

“Hey ser, may I ask why you want to pay with this metal store of value instead of using the new BScoin? Did you know that you can instantly pay with your smartwatch ser?

Matthew didn’t even try to respond, he grabbed his coffee, walked outside and he took a seat at a table outside and sipped his coffee, enjoying the warmth and the taste. But as he drank, he noticed a faint beep coming from his smartwatch. He glanced down and saw that the BScrypto monitor app had detected something unusual.

His heart rate had spiked, and his blood pressure had risen. The app had flagged it as a potential threat to his health. Matthew was taken aback. It was so early in the morning that he had almost forgotten about the constant monitoring, even when he was doing something as simple as drinking coffee. His own hearth beat data was stored on a blockchain faster than he could drink his coffee(and it's immutable). Ah and now all the apps are dapps and in order to own hardware you needed to have then preinstalled on the device.

He finished his coffee quickly and got up to leave. As he walked away, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Even something as innocent as a morning coffee could be used to track, monitor him and map data models from which they could extract profits.

Matthew walked cautiously through the deserted streets heading for his home, his senses were heightened by the fear of being "watched". Caught up in his mind, he noticed some kids playing soccer with a metal orb, but when he looked closer it was a Wordlcoin orb. This made him smile for a moment, but then he remembered that removing the orbs was punishable by law and the perpetrators had to get scanned in order to be identified and banned by the Wordlapp. They could never own Wordlcoins and could never be part of their financial system. Now we had multiple financial systems, but none were credibly neutral or tailored to the actual needs of the people or the environment.

The world he lived in was nothing like he had ever imagined, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease at every turn. Crypto, which had started out as a way to liberate people from financial oppression, had only served to grow the social and economic differences between people.

He knew that he was one of the few thousand people who understood the true nature of crypto, and that made him a target. Crypto was now being used as a tool to monitor people, and the vast majority of it was closed and not open source.

He turned a corner and saw a group of men in suits approaching him. They looked like they belonged to a corporation, the kind that used crypto to control people. He tried to walk past them unnoticed, but they blocked his way.

"Mr. Matthew, we've been looking for you," said one of the men.

Matthew tried to keep his cool, but his heart was racing. He knew that he had to be careful, to not reveal anything that could incriminate him.

"What do you want?" he asked.

"We want to talk to you about your activities in web3 ser. We think that you could be a valuable asset to our company," said the man.

Our digital warrior knew that this was a trap, but he didn't know what to do. He was trapped, with no way out. He tried to think of a way to escape, but his mind was clouded with fear and uncertainty. He knew that he had to act fast, before it was too late.

As he tried to run away, a strange sensation came over him. Everything around him seemed to blur, and he felt a surreal detachment from his surroundings. Suddenly, he stumbled, losing his balance. The world around him twisted and distorted, and he found himself falling into an abyss of darkness.

With a jolt, Matthew woke up, drenched in sweat. He sat up in bed, his heart pounding in his chest. It took a few moments for him to gather his thoughts and realize that it had all been a dream—an intensely vivid and terrifying dream.

He reached for his phone and opened Discord and as he scrolled through the conversations, he was reminded of the real world—the world where organizations like Ethereum, Gitcoin, the Open Data Community, Refi, Giveth, Ocean protocol BrightID and many others were actively working to ensure that the dystopian future he had dreamed about would never come to pass.

Relief flooded over Matthew as he read about the efforts being made to promote decentralization, open-source technology, and data privacy. He felt a renewed sense of hope and determination. The dream had shaken him to the core, but it also served as a reminder of the importance of the fight he was a part of.

He knew that the journey would be challenging, and there would be moments of doubt and fear along the way. But he was not alone. There were others, passionate and dedicated individuals, working tirelessly to build a future that embraced the true principles of crypto—the principles of empowerment, inclusivity, and transparency.

With a newfound sense of purpose, he got out of bed, ready to face the day. He knew that his dream had served as a wake-up call, urging him to stay vigilant and committed to the cause. The road ahead might be filled with obstacles, but he was deter mined to contribute to the movement and help shape a better future—one where the power of crypto would truly serve the people and not the entities what only seek capital accumulation,

And so, with unwavering resolve, Matthew stepped out into the world, ready to join the collective efforts that would pave the way for a brighter tomorrow. The bright web is real and its light can now shine brighter than ever!
